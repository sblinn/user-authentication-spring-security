# user-authentication-spring-security
Java user authentication web application using Spring Security, JPA, SQL, and Thymeleaf. Utilizes Spring Security's authentication and authorization features to allow visitors and existing users to create new accounts and login to view pages depending on their access. User passwords are encrypted and user login information is stored in userlogin database. 

This is intended to be the simplest implementation of Spring Security's services, specifically using updated methods suggested by Spring developers, instead of the now deprecated WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter. Features may be added or adapted (ie. user may require more information, such as email and name, or more authorization options). 

Future edits will allow admin access.
